###  Hello There!

This repository is intended to provide an example for people to learn how *Git* and *GitHub* work, without messing with any project. Feel free to change files (aside this README) and upload new ones.

Mostly likely you are here becuase you are using **Benedict College's FOSS Tutorial**. You can practice *forking* a repository on GitHub using this reposiory.

Creating a *fork* is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit *Pull Requests* to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

After forking this repository, you can make some changes to the project, and submit a Pull Request as practice.
